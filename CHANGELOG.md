## 2.0.4
- Add topics to pubspec.yaml for better discoverability on pub.dev.


## 2.0.3
- Fix: static log pass analitics return type <void> instead of <dynamic>.

## 2.0.2
- Fix: The `Console` class was not properly exporting the `enableColors` and `showTimestamp` properties. Now, these properties are correctly defined as static variables, allowing users to control the output formatting as intended.
